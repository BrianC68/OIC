## Ozaukee Ice Center Locker Room Assignments Television Display Programs

The Ozaukee Ice Center has two ice rinks, North Rink and South Rink.  I have written programs to dynamically assign locker rooms for daily events and display them on televisions in the lobbies of each rink.  There are three Python programs for each rink running on Raspberry Pi's.  One program scrapes the Ozaukee Ice Center Schedule web site for the days events, assigns locker rooms if needed and saves the assignments to a csv file.  The second program displays the locker room assignments on a television in the lobby and also rotates through any messages or advertisements in the messages folder.  The third program is a GUI the rink director uses to edit the locker assignments if needed.

## Ozaukee Ice Center Concessions Television Display Program

The Concessions television displays the concessions menu and any optional messages or advertisements in the messages folder.  The rink director simply uploads an image file to the menu folder on the Raspberry Pi to make changes to the menu.
